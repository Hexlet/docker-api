            Note that a running container can be _paused_. The `Running` and `Paused`
            booleans are not mutually exclusive:

            When pausing a container (on Linux), the freezer cgroup is used to suspend
            all processes in the container. Freezing the process requires the process to
            be running. As a result, paused containers are both `Running` _and_ `Paused`.

            Use the `Status` field instead to determine if a container's state is "running".

            description: |
              A list of volume bindings for this container. Each volume binding
              is a string in one of these forms:

              - `host-src:container-dest[:options]` to bind-mount a host path
                into the container. Both `host-src`, and `container-dest` must
                be an _absolute_ path.
              - `volume-name:container-dest[:options]` to bind-mount a volume
                managed by a volume driver into the container. `container-dest`
                must be an _absolute_ path.

              `options` is an optional, comma-delimited list of:

              - `nocopy` disables automatic copying of data from the container
                path to the volume. The `nocopy` flag only applies to named volumes.
              - `[ro|rw]` mounts a volume read-only or read-write, respectively.
                If omitted or set to `rw`, volumes are mounted read-write.
              - `[z|Z]` applies SELinux labels to allow or deny multiple containers
                to read and write to the same volume.
                  - `z`: a _shared_ content label is applied to the content. This
                    label indicates that multiple containers can share the volume
                    content, for both reading and writing.
                  - `Z`: a _private unshared_ label is applied to the content.
                    This label indicates that only the current container can use
                    a private volume. Labeling systems such as SELinux require
                    proper labels to be placed on volume content that is mounted
                    into a container. Without a label, the security system can
                    prevent a container's processes from using the content. By
                    default, the labels set by the host operating system are not
                    modified.
              - `[[r]shared|[r]slave|[r]private]` specifies mount
                [propagation behavior](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt).
                This only applies to bind-mounted volumes, not internal volumes
                or named volumes. Mount propagation requires the source mount
                point (the location where the source directory is mounted in the
                host operating system) to have the correct propagation properties.
                For shared volumes, the source mount point must be set to `shared`.
                For slave volumes, the mount must be set to either `shared` or
                `slave`.

        The version number of the object such as node, service, etc. This is needed

        with the modified specification when updating these objects.

        This approach ensures safe concurrency and determinism in that the change
        on the object may not be applied if the version number has changed from the
        last read. In other words, if two update requests specify the same base
        version, only one of the requests can succeed. As a result, two separate
        update requests that happen at the same time will not unintentionally
        overwrite each other.

            List of IP ranges of insecure registries, using the CIDR syntax
            ([RFC 4632](https://tools.ietf.org/html/4632)). Insecure registries
            accept un-encrypted (HTTP) and/or untrusted (HTTPS with certificates
            from unknown CAs) communication.

            By default, local registries (`::1/128` and `127.0.0.0/8`) are configured as
            insecure. All other registries are secure. Communicating with an
            insecure registry is not possible if the daemon assumes that registry
            is secure.

            This configuration override this behavior, insecure communication with
            registries whose resolved IP address is within the subnet described by
            the CIDR syntax.

            Registries can also be marked insecure by hostname. Those registries
            are listed under `IndexConfigs` and have their `Secure` field set to
            `false`.

            > **Warning**: Using this option can be useful when running a local
            > registry, but introduces security vulnerabilities. This option
            > should therefore ONLY be used for testing purposes. For increased
            > security, users should add their CA to their system's list of trusted
            > CAs instead of enabling this option.

            Name and, optional, path, of the OCI executable binary.

            If the path is omitted, the daemon searches the host's `$PATH` for the
            binary and uses the first result.

            The Docker daemon relies on an OCI compliant runtime (invoked via the
            `containerd` daemon) as its interface to the Linux kernel namespaces,
            cgroups, and SELinux.

            The default runtime is `runc`, and automatically configured. Additional
            runtimes can be configured by the user and will be listed here.
          example:

    The Engine API is an HTTP API served by Docker Engine. It is the API the
    Docker client uses to communicate with the Engine, so everything the Docker
    client can do can be done with the API.

    Most of the client's commands map directly to API endpoints (e.g. `docker ps`
    is `GET /containers/json`). The notable exception is running containers,
    which consists of several API calls.

    # Errors

    The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure
    of the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following
    format:

    ```
    {
      "message": "page not found"
    }
    ```

    # Versioning

    The API is usually changed in each release, so API calls are versioned to
    ensure that clients don't break. To lock to a specific version of the API,
    you prefix the URL with its version, for example, call `/v1.30/info` to use
    the v1.30 version of the `/info` endpoint. If the API version specified in
    the URL is not supported by the daemon, a HTTP `400 Bad Request` error message
    is returned.

    If you omit the version-prefix, the current version of the API (v1.50) is used.
    For example, calling `/info` is the same as calling `/v1.52/info`. Using the
    API without a version-prefix is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

    Engine releases in the near future should support this version of the API,
    so your client will continue to work even if it is talking to a newer Engine.

    The API uses an open schema model, which means the server may add extra properties
    to responses. Likewise, the server will ignore any extra query parameters and
    request body properties. When you write clients, you need to ignore additional
    properties in responses to ensure they do not break when talking to newer
    daemons.


    # Authentication

    Authentication for registries is handled client side. The client has to send
    authentication details to various endpoints that need to communicate with
    registries, such as `POST /images/(name)/push`. These are sent as
    `X-Registry-Auth` header as a [base64url encoded](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5)
    (JSON) string with the following structure:

    ```
    {
      "username": "string",
      "password": "string",
      "serveraddress": "string"
    }
    ```

    The `serveraddress` is a domain/IP without a protocol. Throughout this
    structure, double quotes are required.

    If you have already got an identity token from the [`/auth` endpoint](#operation/SystemAuth),
    you can just pass this instead of credentials:

    ```
    {
      "identitytoken": "9cbaf023786cd7..."
    }
    ```

                The default on Linux is version "2" (BuildKit), but the daemon

        Build an image from a tar archive with a `Dockerfile` in it.

        The `Dockerfile` specifies how the image is built from the tar archive. It is typically in the archive's root, but can be at a different path or have a different name by specifying the `dockerfile` parameter. [See the `Dockerfile` reference for more information](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

        The Docker daemon performs a preliminary validation of the `Dockerfile` before starting the build, and returns an error if the syntax is incorrect. After that, each instruction is run one-by-one until the ID of the new image is output.

        The build is canceled if the client drops the connection by quitting or being killed.

        Attach to a container to read its output or send it input. You can attach
        to the same container multiple times and you can reattach to containers
        that have been detached.

        Either the `stream` or `logs` parameter must be `true` for this endpoint
        to do anything.

        See the [documentation for the `docker attach` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach/)
        for more details.

        ### Hijacking

        This endpoint hijacks the HTTP connection to transport `stdin`, `stdout`,
        and `stderr` on the same socket.

        This is the response from the daemon for an attach request:

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: application/vnd.docker.raw-stream

        [STREAM]
        ```

        After the headers and two new lines, the TCP connection can now be used
        for raw, bidirectional communication between the client and server.

        To hint potential proxies about connection hijacking, the Docker client
        can also optionally send connection upgrade headers.

        For example, the client sends this request to upgrade the connection:

        ```
        POST /containers/16253994b7c4/attach?stream=1&stdout=1 HTTP/1.1
        Upgrade: tcp
        Connection: Upgrade
        ```

        The Docker daemon will respond with a `101 UPGRADED` response, and will
        similarly follow with the raw stream:

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 101 UPGRADED
        Content-Type: application/vnd.docker.raw-stream
        Connection: Upgrade
        Upgrade: tcp

        [STREAM]
        ```

        ### Stream format

        When the TTY setting is disabled in [`POST /containers/create`](#operation/ContainerCreate),
        the HTTP Content-Type header is set to application/vnd.docker.multiplexed-stream
        and the stream over the hijacked connected is multiplexed to separate out
        `stdout` and `stderr`. The stream consists of a series of frames, each
        containing a header and a payload.

        The header contains the information which the stream writes (`stdout` or
        `stderr`). It also contains the size of the associated frame encoded in
        the last four bytes (`uint32`).

        It is encoded on the first eight bytes like this:

        ```go
        header := [8]byte{STREAM_TYPE, 0, 0, 0, SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4}
        ```

        `STREAM_TYPE` can be:

        - 0: `stdin` (is written on `stdout`)
        - 1: `stdout`
        - 2: `stderr`

        `SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4` are the four bytes of the `uint32` size
        encoded as big endian.

        Following the header is the payload, which is the specified number of
        bytes of `STREAM_TYPE`.

        The simplest way to implement this protocol is the following:

        1. Read 8 bytes.
        2. Choose `stdout` or `stderr` depending on the first byte.
        3. Extract the frame size from the last four bytes.
        4. Read the extracted size and output it on the correct output.
        5. Goto 1.

        ### Stream format when using a TTY

        When the TTY setting is enabled in [`POST /containers/create`](#operation/ContainerCreate),
        the stream is not multiplexed. The data exchanged over the hijacked
        connection is simply the raw data from the process PTY and client's
        `stdin`.

          This is useful for attaching to a container that has started and you
          want to output everything since the container started.

          If `stream` is also enabled, once all the previous output has been
          returned, it will seamlessly transition into streaming current
          output.

  /containers/{id}/stats:
    get:
      description: |
        This endpoint returns a live stream of a container’s resource usage
        statistics.

        The `precpu_stats` is the CPU statistic of the *previous* read, and is
        used to calculate the CPU usage percentage. It is not an exact copy
        of the `cpu_stats` field.

        If either `precpu_stats.online_cpus` or `cpu_stats.online_cpus` is
        nil then for compatibility with older daemons the length of the
        corresponding `cpu_usage.percpu_usage` array should be used.

        On a cgroup v2 host, the following fields are not set
        * `blkio_stats`: all fields other than `io_service_bytes_recursive`
        * `cpu_stats`: `cpu_usage.percpu_usage`
        * `memory_stats`: `max_usage` and `failcnt`
        Also, `memory_stats.stats` fields are incompatible with cgroup v1.

        To calculate the values shown by the `stats` command of the docker cli tool
        the following formulas can be used:
        * used_memory = `memory_stats.usage - memory_stats.stats.cache` (cgroups v1)
        * used_memory = `memory_stats.usage - memory_stats.stats.inactive_file` (cgroups v2)
        * available_memory = `memory_stats.limit`
        * Memory usage % = `(used_memory / available_memory) * 100.0`
        * cpu_delta = `cpu_stats.cpu_usage.total_usage - precpu_stats.cpu_usage.total_usage`
        * system_cpu_delta = `cpu_stats.system_cpu_usage - precpu_stats.system_cpu_usage`
        * number_cpus = `length(cpu_stats.cpu_usage.percpu_usage)` or `cpu_stats.online_cpus`
        * CPU usage % = `(cpu_delta / system_cpu_delta) * number_cpus * 100.0`

          Platform in the format `os[/arch[/variant]]` used for image lookup.

          When specified, the daemon checks if the requested image is present
          in the local image cache with the given OS and Architecture, and
          otherwise returns a `404` status.

          If the option is not set, the host's native OS and Architecture are
          used to look up the image in the image cache. However, if no platform
          is passed and the given image does exist in the local image cache,
          but its OS or architecture does not match, the container is created
          with the available image, and a warning is added to the `Warnings`
          field in the response, for example;

        Get a tarball containing all images and metadata for a repository.

        If `name` is a specific name and tag (e.g. `ubuntu:latest`), then only that image (and its parents) are returned. If `name` is an image ID, similarly only that image (and its parents) are returned, but with the exclusion of the `repositories` file in the tarball, as there were no image names referenced.

        ### Image tarball format

        An image tarball contains [Content as defined in the OCI Image Layout Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.1.1/image-layout.md#content).

        Additionally, includes the manifest.json file associated with a backwards compatible docker save format.

        If the tarball defines a repository, the tarball should also include a `repositories` file at the root that contains a list of repository and tag names mapped to layer IDs.

        ```json
        {
          "hello-world": {
            "latest": "565a9d68a73f6706862bfe8409a7f659776d4d60a8d096eb4a3cbce6999cc2a1"

          - If `fromImage` includes a digest, the image is pulled by digest, and `tag` is ignored.

          Platform in the format os[/arch[/variant]].

          When used in combination with the `fromImage` option, the daemon checks
          if the given image is present in the local image cache with the given
          OS and Architecture, and otherwise attempts to pull the image. If the
          option is not set, the host's native OS and Architecture are used.
          If the given image does not exist in the local image cache, the daemon
          attempts to pull the image with the host's native OS and Architecture.
          If the given image does exists in the local image cache, but its OS or
          architecture does not match, a warning is produced.

          When used with the `fromSrc` option to import an image from an archive,
          this option sets the platform information for the imported image. If
          the option is not set, the host's native OS and Architecture are used
          for the imported image.

        Start a new interactive session with a server. Session allows server to
        call back to the client for advanced capabilities.

        > **Deprecated**: This endpoint is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
        > Server should support gRPC directly on the listening socket.

        ### Hijacking

        This endpoint hijacks the HTTP connection to HTTP2 transport that allows
        the client to expose gPRC services on that connection.

        For example, the client sends this request to upgrade the connection:

        ```
        POST /session HTTP/1.1
        Upgrade: h2c
        Connection: Upgrade
        ```

        The Docker daemon responds with a `101 UPGRADED` response follow with
        the raw stream:

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 101 UPGRADED
        Connection: Upgrade
        Upgrade: h2c
        ```
